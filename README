MODULAR CALENDAR
================

A highly extensible, easy to use, database-driven PHP calendar for your website.
Once installed, you must modify config/Settings.php for the calendar to access 
your database.

=========
FEATURES
=========
1. Database Abstraction Layer (see resources/cal-DBAL.inc) for finer control of database queries
2. GUI Abstraction Layer (see resources/cal-GUI.inc) for finer control of calendar rendering
3. Extensible Management Interface and Classes (see resources/management.inc) for CRUD transactions anywhere in your site
4. Customizable views (day, week, month, upcoming, featured, and term views are provided by default).
5. Customizable themes (modify themes/default.css or duplicate it and create your own) 

== NOTE ==
The Plugin Calendar GUI is read-only. It does not provide any way to add or remove events.
However, the default managers make this easy to do programmatically. This is especially useful if
you have an existing system, or you want to able to add events from other pages.

See index.php for an example of invoking the calendar.
