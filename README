your database.

FEATURES
=========
1. Database Abstraction Layer (see resources/cal-DBAL.inc)
2. GUI Abstraction Layer (see resources/cal-GUI.inc)
3. Extensible Management Interface and Classes (see resources/management.inc)
4. Customizable views (day, week, month, upcoming, featured, and term views are provided).
5. Customizable themes (modify or duplicate themes/default.css to create your own) 

== NOTE ==
The Plugin Calendar GUI is read-only. It does not provide any way to add or remove events.
However, the default managers make this easy to do programmatically. This is especially useful if
you have an existing database, or you want to able to add events from other pages.

See index.php for an example of invoking the calendar.
